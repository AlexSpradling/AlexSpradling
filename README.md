### Hi there ðŸ‘‹My name is Alex Spradling

Data Scientist | Mariner

I am a data scientist and professional mariner. I've spent the last decade at sea, serving as a deck officer in the U.S. Merchant Marine on everything from massive cruise ships to high-speed passenger ferries. I've been to the arctic circle and I've sailed through a hurricane (I don't recommend that), transported billions of dollars of cargo and safely transported hundreds of thousands of people. My time on the water has given me a deep appreciation for the power of data, mathematics, and technology (you can't navigate a ship without them!).
              
I discovered a love for programming during my time on shore, and dove in headfirst. With each break from work, I found myself coding and expanding my technological skillsets.  I am now full time in the world of data science, having recently graduated as a Data Science Fellow from General Assembly. 
                    
I am open to collaboration and opportunities â€” looking for a role where I can apply my skills, education, and experience to thoughtful and impactful work.
