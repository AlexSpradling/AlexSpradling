I am a data scientist and professional mariner, from the NYC area. I hold a master's degree in International Transportation Management from SUNY Maritime College. 

I've spent more than a decade sailing as a senior ship's officer in the US merchant marine--from monstrous one thousand foot cruise ships and container ships to cutting-edge high speed passenger ferries. There a million systems on a ship that can be optimized with code, I started teaching myself during my time ashore and fell in love with data science.
