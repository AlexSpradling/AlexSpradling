### Hello

Data Scientist | Mariner

I'm a professional mariner and data scientist, actively sailing as Captain in the United States Merchant Marine. 

I get uncomfortable just doing one thing, so when I'm ashore, I love to [write code and solve problems with data](https://github.com/AlexSpradling?tab=repositories), as well as [play the double bass and piano](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU69tZVC5um2UJALw11vSiQ). I think a life well lived is one where the learning simply never stops.
