I'm a mariner and data scientist. Currently sailing as Captain in the United States Merchant Marine. 

When I'm ashore, I love to [write code and solve problems with data](https://github.com/AlexSpradling?tab=repositories), as well as [play the double bass and piano](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU69tZVC5um2UJALw11vSiQ). 

I think a life well lived is one where the learning never stops.
