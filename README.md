### Hello

Data Scientist | Mariner

I'm a professional mariner and data scientist, actively sailing as Captain in the United States Merchant Marine. 

I get uncomfortable just doing one thing, so When I'm ashore, I love to write code and solve problems with data, as well as play the double bass and piano. I think a life well lived is one where the learning simply never stops.
